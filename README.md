# interaction_assignment_Interaction Assignment
For this assignment, I used the dataset from my final project presentation to highlight the salaries, win share percentages, and value scores of the NBA all-star players I selected. My visualization plots each player’s salary against either their team’s win shares or their individual value score.
I implemented three types of interaction:

Details on demand through tooltips that appear when you hover over a data point, showing key player statistics.
Next, filtering using a dropdown menu that allows the user to filter players by position and lastly, Encoding via a toggle button that lets the user switch the Y-axis between win shares and value score.
